## KPIâ€™s Requirement

# The HR department
is responsible for monitoring and managing various aspects of employee data to ensure the organization maintains a healthy workforce. However, there is a lack of clear performance indicators to track and analyze key HR metrics. Therefore, there is a need to design and implement a set of KPIs to address the following points:

# Employee Count:
The HR department lacks visibility into the total number of employees, making it challenging to assess workforce size and plan for future growth or downsizing effectively.

# Attrition Count:
The organization lacks a standardized method to track employee attrition, resulting in incomplete and unreliable data on the number of employees who have left the organization.

# Attrition Rate:
Without a clear measure of attrition rate, the organization cannot assess the overall turnover level or compare it with industry benchmarks, hindering the ability to gauge employee satisfaction and engagement.

# Active Employees:
The organization lacks a mechanism to differentiate between active and inactive employees, leading to difficulties in accurately assessing the current workforce's productivity and capacity.

# Average Age:
The HR department lacks visibility into the average age of employees, making it difficult to evaluate workforce demographics, succession planning, and the organization's ability to attract and retain younger talent.
